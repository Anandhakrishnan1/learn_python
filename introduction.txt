INTRODUCTION

        Like all high-level languages, Python is easy to read, takes less time to write, and is portable. This versatile 
programming language has two versions: Python 2 and Python 3. Wiki says: Python 2.x is legacy, Python 3.x is the present and
future of the language. That is, Python 2 is no longer in development and all new features will be added in Python 3. Note that, 
keeping this in mind, the code examples in this tutorial are in Python 3. Wherever Python 2.x code is shown, it will be 
highlighted.
        
EXECUTION

        Python executes code top to bottom, when written in the correct syntax. To execute the code in our python tutorials, you
will need to install python in your machine as a prerequisite. A small description on how to install Python and get the 
interpreter running is given here. Once the interpreter is running you can start typing in commands to get the result.
        
INPUT USING THE input() FUNCTION

                A function is defined as a block of organized, reusable code used to perform a single, related action. Python has
many built-in functions; you can also create your own. Python has an input function which lets you ask a user for some text
input. You call this function to tell the program to stop and wait for the user to key in the data. In Python 2, you have a 
built-in function raw_input(), whereas in Python 3, you have input(). The program will resume once the user presses the ENTER or
RETURN key. Look at this example to get input from the keyboard using Python 2 in the interactive mode. Your output is displayed 
in quotes once you hit the ENTER key.
                
      >>>raw_input()
       I am learning at hackerearth   (This is where you type in)
      'I am learning at hackerearth' (The interpreter showing you how the input is captured.)
      
      
      In Python 3.x, you need to use input().
      >>> input()
      I am learning at hackerearth.
      'I am learning at hackerearth.'
