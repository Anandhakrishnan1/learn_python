    "  A function is defined as a block of organized, reusable code used to perform a single, related action. Python has many built-in functions; you can also create your own. Python has an input function which lets you ask a user for some text input. You call this function to tell the program to stop and wait for the user to key in the data. In Python 2, you have a built-in function raw_input(), whereas in Python 3, you have input(). The program will resume once the user presses the ENTER or RETURN key. Look at this example to get input from the keyboard using Python 2 in the interactive mode. Your output is displayed in quotes once you hit the ENTER key."

For example, when you give a sentence \"generic input\" as the input, this gets assigned to a variable, say, my_var. You can then print the value stored in my_var.
